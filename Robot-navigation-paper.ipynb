    "### Introduction\n",
    "The ability of an autonomous vehicle to sense obstacles and navigate its surroundings is a key role in the development of modern robots. For this reason we present a project in which a robot, through the principle of a stereo camera, is able to perceive the obstacles in front of his view. Such technology could be implemented by a navigation system for autonomous vehicles to automatically avoid obstacles."

    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of the project aims to use synchronized video sequences captured by a stereo camera mounted on a moving vehicle to detect spatial information of the frontal environment. The primary task is to develop an area-based stereo matching algorithm capable of generating a dense disparity map from the syncronized stereo camera inputs (robotL.avi for the left view, robotR.avi for the right view). Then by using geometrical calculations an extimated distance from the robot to the central area of the view need to be calculated. Additionally, an alarm is triggered whenever the distance falls below 0.8 meters.\n",
    "Finally, given that in the center of the sciene there is a chessboard. The dimension of it (height and width) must be computed. This will be useful in order to compare it to the real values and give an extimation of the accuracy of the method used.  \n",
