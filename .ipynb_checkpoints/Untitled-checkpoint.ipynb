    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### The ability of an autonomous vehicle to sense obstacles and navigate its surroundings is a key role in the development of modern robots. For this reason we present a project in which a robot, through the principle of a stereo camera, is able to perceive the obstacles in front of his view. Such technology could be implemented by a navigation system for autonomous vehicles to automatically avoid obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The objective of the project aims to use synchronized video sequences captured by a stereo camera mounted on a moving vehicle to detect spatial information of the frontal environment.\n"
